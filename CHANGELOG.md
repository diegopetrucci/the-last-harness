# Changelog

All notable changes to The Last Harness will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Gnosis is now installed and enabled by default on supported platforms for profiles without an existing preference; `--without-gnosis` and `tlh gnosis disable` remain persistent opt-outs across `tlh update`.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- `tlh update` now reruns the installer update flow while preserving latest-release, pinned-tag, or ref/main update tracks.
- TLH now checks GitHub Releases in the background at startup and warns once when a newer release is available.
- Bundled `npm:@diegopetrucci/pi-openai-fast` as a default extension.
- Bundled `npm:@plannotator/pi-extension` as a default extension.

### Changed

- Expanded install and local-development guidance now lives in focused docs linked from the README.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- Bundled `npm:@diegopetrucci/pi-context-inspector` as a default extension.
- Bundled `npm:@diegopetrucci/pi-librarian` as a default extension.
- Added a `DUMB ZONE` footer warning after context usage when context exceeds 200k tokens.

### Changed

- The TLH footer no longer shows token counters, subscription cost estimates, or the auto-compaction indicator.
- The default editor horizontal padding is now set to 1.
- README bundled-extension entries now link to their upstream package source.
- The startup header now shows context files on a single `Context:` line.
- The startup header now omits the keybinding hint line.
- The startup header now omits the upstream Pi version and shows the TLH version plus releases link only on the first launch after a TLH version change.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- The TLH footer now shows steering and follow-up queue key hints while the user is typing during active agent work.
- README now includes a concise features overview.
- Added `scripts/release-notes.mjs` for tag-specific release notes sourced from `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Changed

- GitHub Releases now use the matching `CHANGELOG.md` section as release notes instead of generated commit summaries.
- Refined README install and update guidance.
- Release documentation now covers changelog-backed GitHub Release notes.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-10

### Added

- Optional Gnosis (`gn`) integration with install-time opt-in, `tlh gnosis` management commands, isolated managed binary support, and conditional system-prompt guidance.
- Added `tlh gnosis status`, `tlh gnosis enable`, and `tlh gnosis disable` helper commands for the isolated profile.
- Added Gnosis installer flags (`--with-gnosis`, `--without-gnosis`, and `--no-gnosis`) and managed-binary `PATH` handling in the wrapper.
- Added a custom TLH footer showing working directory, git branch, session name, token/cost/context stats, model/thinking state, and extension statuses.

### Changed

- The footer suppresses zero-cost estimates for subscription-backed usage.
- README and release checks now document and validate the Gnosis helper script.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-05-09

### Changed

- Replaced the bundled `pi-compact-bash` default extension with `pi-quiet-tools`.

- Conservative isolated settings merge for `~/.the-last-harness/agent`.
- Bundled Pi extension, skill, prompt, and theme resources.
- Bundled default-extension opt-out management via `tlh defaults`.
- Bundled default external extensions for permissions, Oracle review, notifications, context caps, quieter bash output, and destructive-action confirmations.
