`tlh` (The Last Harness) is an opinionated harness built on top of [Pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi).

Two core ideas drive it:

- _"you can outsource your thinking, but not your understanding"_: LLMs can, and should, provide options, help out with discovery and exploration, filling the gaps in your understanding and technical knowledge — they should not, however, be used as a replacement for understanding. [Beware of cognitive debt](https://simonwillison.net/2026/Feb/15/cognitive-debt/).
- _you should not be babysitting your agents_: if you need to manually call tools, run commands, and so on, the harness has failed you.

It achieves this [via a custom orchestration workflow](https://www.stavros.io/posts/how-i-write-software-with-llms/) — you only interface with an architect, whom you engage as a senior peer, and once you're satisfied with the discussion and plan, it takes over until everything is done. Work is pre-reviewed too, often multiple times, so that your time is not wasted in minutiae, freeing you to focus on the bigger picture.

You're also not asked to manually run commands, manage context, or anything like that. This is built-in and done for you. Every further action that you take is because you _want_ to take it, not because you _have_ to. You should not be finding yourself thinking eg "oh, I forgot to trigger `/review`". Your time is worth more.

`tlh` is also slow by default, and relatively token-expensive: it is designed to be used as a long-running, reliable, and predictable tool. You spend time preparing the work, and once it's off, it's off. No babysitting.

If this resonates with you, welcome aboard:

## Workflows

`tlh` has a few primary workflows/personas: architect, rush, product, bug-hunter, disabled. Each of them has different purpose, encoded with a different system prompt, available tools, and subagents. You can switch between primary agents at any time by pressing `shift` + `tab` — but I would suggest to try not to cross-contaminate the same session (start new ones!).

### The architect

![Illustration of the TLH architect-first workflow: a request passes through approval, tk tickets, scout/build/review child sessions, and returns a judged result.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/diegopetrucci/the-last-harness/main/assets/main-tlh-workflow-illustrations/01-main-tlh-workflow.png)

As a software engineer, you will likely spend most of your time with the **architect** primary agent. The architect does not do any change directly, but its purpose is to help you investigate, find issues, plan the work, and so on. It is banned from making (bigger) direct changes, and it will always propose to encode the plan/work into smaller tickets.

At times, the architect might seem eager to ask you to `approve` the plan. Do not feel afraid to push back and continue exploring and understanding the stakes. This is _your_ work, own it, and explore all possibilities. Also feel free to start new sessions, and treat existing ones as throwaways to get a better idea of what's going on. Rarely one is able to come up with the shape of work on the first try.

The architect has access to a few subagents, which can be divided in three big categories:

- Single-purpose, automatically-invoked ones to keep its context smaller: the librarian to check git repos, web-scout for the internet, etc.
- Core: as the agent does not write code, 1+ developer(s) are tasked to. Same for the reviewer, which avoids you having to run tools like `/review` yourself.
- Optional, second-opinions: the oracle, and the contrarian. The architect might suggest using them, but it will always be up to you whether to actually invoke them.

Notably, the oracle, contrarian, and reviewer all run on the opposite provider from your active session — Anthropic primary sessions get OpenAI, and OpenAI/Codex primary sessions get Anthropic — so that their second opinion truly is a second opinion, and not just Claude with a moustache and shades. See [docs/models.md](docs/models.md) for the full detail.

Again, the core idea: explore and plan with the architect. Double check with the oracle/contrarian. Go back and forth. This is where you, as a human, are required. Once happy, the implementation follows, until ready for your review.

A few quick-fire tips to get the most of the architect:

- If the planned work is too big, ask the architect to delegate even just one tk ticket at a time to the developer. You don't need to go all the way at all times.
- `/annotate-last-message` opens a simple native window where you can write comments to specific parts of the architect's last message
- `/tree` lets you go back and forth in the conversation tree. It's similar to Claude Code's `/btw`, but much, much more powerful. I often use it to explore smaller parts of the conversation, and after having done so, I return to the last "clean" message to clear up context (you can do so with or without generated summaries of your nested conversation).
- `/annotate-git-diff`: similar to `/annotate-last-message`, but for git diffs (even tickets!).
- `/merge-origin-main-into-this-branch`: merges the `origin/main` branch into the current branch.
- `/rebase-this-branch-onto-origin-main`: rebases the current branch onto `origin/main`.

### Product, rush, bug-hunter

These are smaller, laser-focused primary agents. I especially recommend `rush` for quicker fixes that the architect's workflow would be overkill for. `product` handles framing, tradeoffs, strategy, and ticket shaping — it doesn't write code. `bug-hunter` is read-only: reach for it when you want root cause before you've decided how to fix something.

## Everything else

### Subagents

Subagent orchestration is first-party TLH functionality: the runtime, prompts, and supervision ship in the root package, so there is no separate subagent package for you to install or pin. The imported test suites live in this repository and run in CI, but are excluded from the published package. Bundled subagents start in a fresh context, isolated from both the primary agent and one another, and the primary gives them just enough context to do their job. Async work, status/steering, durable pause/resume, acceptance evidence, diagnostics, artifacts, and the full migration/undo details are covered in [docs/subagents.md](docs/subagents.md).

User-owned embedded subagents are supported behind the default-off `embedded-subagents` experimental flag; see [docs/embedded-subagents.md](docs/embedded-subagents.md).

All bundled subagents:

- `repo-scout` for discovery
- `diff-summarizer` for change overviews
- `developer` for implementation
- `code-reviewer` for review
- `librarian` for read-only GitHub repository research (uses `gh` CLI and `git`)
- `web-scout` for web research
- `oracle` for a deeper second opinion
- `contrarian` as a bundled default minor subagent for sparing adversarial stress-tests

### Minor-agent model and effort overrides

Use `/subagent-settings` to persist model or effort choices for the bundled TLH minor-agent roles: `code-reviewer`, `contrarian`, `developer`, `diff-summarizer`, `librarian`, `oracle`, `repo-scout`, and `web-scout`.

- `/subagent-settings` opens a picker in the interactive TLH TUI; outside the TUI it reports status.
- `/subagent-settings status [role]` shows all roles or one role.
- `/subagent-settings set <role> [model <provider/id>] [effort <off|minimal|low|medium|high|xhigh|max>]` sets one or both fields; the `model` and `effort` pairs may be given in either order.
- `/subagent-settings reset <role> [model|effort]` clears one field or both, and `/subagent-settings reset-all` clears the saved model/effort fields for bundled roles only.

Values are stored under `subagents.agentOverrides` in the active isolated profile's `settings.json` (normally `~/.the-last-harness/agent/settings.json`, or the profile selected by `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`). A caller-supplied dispatch model takes precedence; otherwise stored role overrides are resolved before bundled provider-aware defaults. A fixed model can reduce provider independence for `code-reviewer`, `oracle`, and `contrarian`, so TLH warns and requires confirmation in UI sessions and refuses those writes in headless mode.

The valid effort values are `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and `max`. Stored effort is applied when the resolved model advertises support (`max` requires `thinkingLevelMap` support); if a saved value is no longer supported, TLH warns and neutralizes it with the bundled effort or explicit `off` when possible. If neither is supported, the subagents runtime drops the unsupported value for a known model; unknown or unresolvable models fail open and still receive the suffix. `max` is also a live bundled default where configured, not a hypothetical value.

When existing settings content is replaced, TLH creates a `settings.json.bak-*` backup and shows its path. To undo a change, use the matching `reset` command, use `reset-all` for bundled roles, or restore the desired `settings.json.bak-*` backup over the active profile's `settings.json`.

See [`docs/commands.md`](docs/commands.md) for the complete grammar, precedence details, warnings, and recovery steps.

### Reconciling overrides with TLH packaged defaults

When TLH ships an update that changes the packaged model or effort default for a role you have overridden, it shows a one-line startup notice: `TLH default model/effort changed for <role> — run /reconcile to review`. The notice is non-blocking and reappears each launch until you act.

Run `/reconcile` to review and resolve the drift:

- **Keep** — acknowledges the new TLH default and preserves your override unchanged. Non-destructive: your setting is untouched.
- **Reset** — clears your override so the role falls back to TLH packaged defaults. For primary agents, the packaged default is also applied to the active session immediately (subject to your `tlh.primaryAgent.applyModel` setting). Undoable: restore the value through the native `/model` picker and choose `All sessions` (the default `This session only — default` option is session-only); for subagents, use `/subagent-settings set <role> ...`. Settings writes always create a `settings.json.bak-*` backup shown in the notification.

The **only trigger** is TLH changing a packaged default for a role you have overridden. There is no periodic or scheduled reminder.

Acknowledgments are per-provider. A Keep or Reset under one provider does not suppress the notice if you later switch providers and that provider's packaged default has since changed.

When the session provider is unknown, TLH defers all comparison — no notice appears and Keep is unavailable until a provider is active. Overrides that pre-date this release are silently backfilled on your first startup with a known provider; the notice then fires on the next packaged-default change after that point, not for any changes that occurred before the backfill.

The reported value is the canonical packaged default for the active provider, resolved from TLH's own bundled catalog. It may name a model your current environment cannot reach, and it may differ from the model Reset produces in a live session (for example, roles that prefer an opposite-provider model will show a same-provider fallback here). That does not block the decision; Keep and Reset work regardless.

Outside the TUI, `/reconcile` prints a read-only drift summary. See [`docs/commands.md`](docs/commands.md) for full details.

### Provider auth-health warning

When TLH dispatches a subagent and the provider's credential fails, a sticky footer warning appears:

```text
⚠ reauth: anthropic
```

The warning is per-provider (both providers are shown in one line when both fail: `⚠ reauth: anthropic, openai-codex`) and **outlives the run that revealed it** — it does not disappear when the failing run finishes. It clears automatically once the credential works again, checked at each dispatch and turn boundary, so no restart is needed. A new session starts clean and re-flags on the next failed dispatch. A toast notification pointing at `/login` appears the first time a provider is flagged within a session.

Credential failures are detected at dispatch time and also from completed runs, including async ones — so a silently degraded `code-reviewer`, `oracle`, or `contrarian` is surfaced even when the failure happened after the tool call returned.

Only unambiguous credential rejections (revoked/expired OAuth grants, 401/403 during token refresh) surface this warning. Transient network failures, rate limits, and server errors are silent — they are retried automatically on the next dispatch.

### Customisation

You can add your own skills, prompts, extensions, and packages to TLH.

User-level:

- `~/.the-last-harness/agent/skills/`
- `~/.the-last-harness/agent/prompts/`
- `~/.the-last-harness/agent/extensions/` (or via `tlh install github-user/repo`)
- `~/.claude/skills/` — TLH also discovers skills from the Anthropic Claude Code user directory

Repo settings:

- `.pi/skills/`
- `.pi/prompts/`
- `.pi/extensions/`
- `.claude/skills/` — project-level Claude Code skills directory; on the primary agent, **project trust must be granted** before this root is read (see `/trust`)

After adding files, installing a package, or saving project trust, run `/reload` in TLH (or restart it) so the new resources are picked up.
